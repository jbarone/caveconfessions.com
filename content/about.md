I have over a decade of experience as a software developer, with a
majority of that time specialized in security design and development. I have a
core background in Java, .Net, Python, Go, and secure design and development.
I am experienced and well practiced in .Net and Java enterprise technologies,
web services, agile methodologies, open source, and test-driven development.
I have worked with a variety of platforms (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Unix),
databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle), J2EE Application Servers,
software development methodologies, and development environments and tools.

I hold a collection of certifications including Certified Information System
Security Professional (CISSP), GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC), GIAC Certified
Incident Handler (GCIH), and GIAC Certified Web Application Penetration Tester
(GWAPT). I also have my Masters of Computer Science from the University of
New Orleans.
