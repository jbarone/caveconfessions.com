I am not normally a person who makes goals on New Years. I'm not really a goal setter in general, or at least I haven't been. What I am, though, is a habit builder. I think that building new habits for my betterment is the right way to go. I think being accountable helps me to stay on track to actually make my habits stick. And to that end, here are some goals that I have for some new habits I'm attempting to build.
