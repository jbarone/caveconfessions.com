On April 1st I was honored by being able to speak again at 
[BSides NOLA](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/104051753/BSidesNOLA%202016).
There were so many wonderful talks, I really wish there are more mes so I could
have attended them all.

My Talk was focused on looking at XSS (Cross Site Scripting) and really digging
into the harm that can really be done, when someone else can control your 
browser. If you missed it, booooo, it was an awesome talk. But, here are the
slides if you want to see what I covered.

- Slides can be found [here](https://github.com/jbarone/Presentations/blob/master/XSS_to_alert_and_beyond/XSS_to_alert_and_beyond.pdf)
- Demo / Lab environment can be found [here](https://github.com/jbarone/xsslab)
