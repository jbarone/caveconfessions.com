On April 16th I had the pleasure of speaking at 
[BSides NOLA](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/104051753/BSidesNOLA%202016).
The conference was excellent, as usual. I learned an absolute ton of cool new 
information, and was able to meet and speak with really smart people. I am 
particularly interested in looking into database forensics a lot more.

My particular talk was titled "The Web's Most Wanted." I had a great time 
giving the talk. And from what I can tell it was well received. I will be 
rolling out a couple new blog posts covering the material from the talk over the
next couple of days. So, please stay tuned for that.
