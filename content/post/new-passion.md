I have always been a person that loved to learn new things. I can be very
obsessive in that way. When I find something that I am interested in, I begin
to research and completely invest myself into that interest. Lately though I
have been passionate about becoming a better software developer, architect, and
security engineer. This means that I have been taking a lot of classes,
certifications, and reading everything I can get my hands on. This has led to
some interesting byproducts. Namely, being invited to join the SANS Mentor
Program.

The [SANS Mentor Program](https://www.sans.org/mentor/) has provided me the
opportunity to turn around and share what I have learned with others in a
structured way. It took the pressure of creating the curriculum off of me, and
just let me share. It inspired me, and I took the initiative to create my own
short lunch and learn sessions to help share web application security practices
that I had learned. It was really after these two events that I discovered I
really enjoyed teaching. Not only is it rewarding for me to help others learn
the things that I have learned, but it also has the excellent benefit for
reinforcing the lessons that I was sharing.

With this new found discovery, I was encouraged to branch out a bit more and
started offering to speak at
[NolaSec](https://sites.google.com/site/nolasecurity/). I have received nothing
but encouraging words from my peers at these various events. This helped
embolden me further, to the point that I submitted a few talks to a few
different conferences. I finally had a talked accepted and very much look
forward to giving it, which I plan to write up that experience in another post.

In the last few weeks I have also joined up with [Operation
Spark](http://oerationspark.org) and are teaching with them. This is super
exciting for me, since the audience for this group is at-risk teens. I'm
working with an amazing group of guys. And we are teaching a group of kids that
are really sharp and are soaking up everything we share with them. So far it's
been a really great experience, and I look forward to seeing this all through.
