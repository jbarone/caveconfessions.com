      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using Vi/Vim for a few years now, as my editor of choice. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m a fairly proficient user, but I find myself constantly discoving new aspects of Vi&amp;rsquo;s badassness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a simple example, last week I found myself making changes to several files. They all needed the same change. Go to the top of the page, and add a line to the second line. Find the occurance of specific string, and remove that line, perform search replace on next two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of doing this was exrememly repetitive and even though I created a macro, it was still time consuming. So&amp;hellip;. to the internets. It turns out there was a way in vim to perform the same command, or in this case vimscript, on every buffer loaded. So with a single line command, I was able to update all of the files in one go, and move on to more intersting work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m happier all the time that I decided to use Vim as my go to editor. I&amp;rsquo;m still learning new things about it all the time, and becoming more and more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
